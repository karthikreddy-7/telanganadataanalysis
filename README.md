# Telangana Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
The Telangana Data Analysis project aims to analyze and derive valuable insights from three key datasets: "fact_stamps," "fact_transport," and "fact_Ts_ipass." These datasets contain a wealth of information related to various aspects of Telangana, including transportation, government services, and public behavior. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of these datasets, we seek to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that can inform decision-making, policy formulation, and future planning for the state.

## Data sources
For data analysis related to Telangana, specifically regarding "fact_stamps," "fact_transport," and "fact_Ts_ipass,"  need to obtain data from relevant sources within Telangana's government or authoritative organizations. Here's a brief overview of potential data sources:

1. **Government Open Data Portals**: The Telangana state government provides open data portals or websites where they share public datasets related to transportation, traffic, and related factors. These portals may offer datasets related to "fact_stamps" and "fact_transport."
2. **Transportation Departments**: The Telangana State Transport Department or related agencies have data related to vehicle registration, traffic violations, road infrastructure, and other transportation-related data.
3. **T-SiPASS**: The Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-Certification System (T-SiPASS)  have data related to industrial projects .
4. **Third-Party Data Providers**: data providers and analytics companies that aggregate and sell data related to various aspects, including transportation and business activities in Telangana. You may explore these providers for relevant datasets, but be mindful of data licensing and costs.
5. **Research Institutions**: Universities or research institutions within Telangana may conduct studies and research projects that involve data related to various aspects of the state, including transportation and business activities and can Contact the institutions could provide valuable data sources.
6. **APIs**: There are any public APIs provided by Telangana government departments or organizations that allow access to real-time or historical data related to transportation and business activities.

## Usage

1.**Data Sources** : Collect data from "fact_stamps," "fact_transport," and "fact_Ts_ipass" sources.
2. **Data Cleaning** : Prepare and clean the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.
3.**Data Modeling** : Create data models in Power BI to establish relationships between the different data sources.
4. **Data Visualization**: Use Power BI's visualization tools to create interactive dashboards and reports.
5. **Analysis**: Analyze the data to derive insights, trends, and patterns related to stamps, transport, and Ts_ipass data.
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) using Power BI visuals to track the progress of your analysis.
7. **Sharing** : Share your Power BI reports and dashboards with stakeholders for decision-making and collaboration.
8. **Iterative Analysis** : Continuously refine your analysis based on feedback and changing data.

Power BI provides a user-friendly platform for data analysis and visualization, making it an excellent choice for exploring and presenting insights from diverse datasets like "fact_stamps," "fact_transport," and "fact_Ts_ipass" in Telangana.
